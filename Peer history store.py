"""
peer_history_store.py
================
Persists PeerInfo.address_history to disk — the piece
connection_behavior_stats.py depends on, which currently vanishes on
every restart, unlike network_ledger/token_ledger/dna_state which
already got this treatment.

WHAT GETS SAVED, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY DOESN'T
----------------------------------------------------
Saved: node_id, address_history (host/port/timestamp tuples), last_seen.
NOT saved: signing_pub, session_key, writer — these are live crypto
session state that should come from a REAL fresh handshake on
reconnect, not be restored from disk. Restoring a session key from a
file would mean trusting a peer's identity without actually
re-verifying their signature, which defeats the point of the
handshake. So after a restart, you get back the connection HISTORY,
but the node still has to actually re-handshake with a peer before
trusting them again — this is a deliberate security boundary, not an
oversight.
