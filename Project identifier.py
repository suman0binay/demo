"""
project_identifier.py
================
A single, real, verifiable identifier for the ENTIRE codebase built
in this project — every file's actual bytes, hashed, combined into
one fingerprint. Same technique digital_dna.py uses for chain blocks
(hash each real thing, fold them together), applied one level up: to
the code itself rather than to events the code produces.

WHAT THIS ACTUALLY PROVES
------------------------------
If you run this against your files and get identifier X, and later
run it again and still get X, you've verified NOTHING changed — not
one byte, in any tracked file. If a single file changes, X changes
completely (that's what a hash is supposed to do). This is real
integrity checking, not a version number someone incremented by hand.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
--------------------
Not a cryptographic signature (no private key involved — anyone can
recompute this from the files, which is the point: it's for YOU to
verify your own files haven't drifted, not to prove authorship to
someone else). Not a replacement for git — git already tracks
per-file history; this gives you one number for "the whole project,
right now" that's fast to compare.

Usage
-----
    python3 project_identifier.py
    # -> prints the current project identifier and a per-file manifest

    from project_identifier import compute_project_identifier
    result = compute_project_identifier()
    print(result["project_id"])
